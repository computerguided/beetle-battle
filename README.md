# Beetle Battle
Beetle Battle board game in Python

# Create executable
The Python script can be packaged into an executable using the ``pyinstaller`` tool (see https://pyinstaller.org)

When the tool is installed, an executable can be created by executing the following command:
```
$ pyinstaller --noconsole --i icon.icns -n "Beetle Battle" beetle-battle.py
```

This will create a ``Beetle Battle.app`` file that can be executed and copied in your applications folder.
